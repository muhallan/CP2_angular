# Bucketlists

This is a front-end app developed with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.
It helps one write down the activities they want to do before they die. This application consumes an API found [here](https://github.com/muhallan/CP2_Bucketlist/).

## Installing the project

```
$ git clone https://github.com/muhallan/CP2_angular.git

$ npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
